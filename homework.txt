Final assignment on the short course of FDTD. 
To be presented, explained and shown to work by YOU, on last day.
Must be uploaded into a fork of your own in github before last day.
Three workgroups, one assignment per workgroup.

1 .- Incorporate non-homogeneus meshes.
     Non-homogeneus: meshes where not all cells have the same size.

2 .- Calculate the reflection coefficient (with respect to frequency)
     of a dielectric slab.
     - Modify program to incorporate dielectric materials.
     - Compute FFT of incident wave.
     - Compute FFT of reflected wave.

3 .- Implement a PML boundary.
