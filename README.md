This program simulates the development of an electromagnetic wave with reflective boundary conditions based on Maxwell's equations.
The electric component is the X-Y plane and the magnetic component is the Z-axis with time steps creating the animation.
This was a project for my "Computational Methods in Theoretical Physics" class, part of the Physics and Mathematics master's program at the University of Granada
